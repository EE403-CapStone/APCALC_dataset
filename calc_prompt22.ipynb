    "The inside of a funnel of height 10 inches has circular cross sections. At height h, the radius of the funnel is given by r=1/20*(3+h^2) , where 0< h < 10. The units of r and h are inches.\n",

    "(c) The funnel contains liquid that is draining from the bottom. At the instant when the height of the liquid is h 3 inches, the radius of the surface of the liquid is decreasing at a rate of  5 inch per second. At this instant, what is the rate of change of the height of the liquid with respect to time?"
