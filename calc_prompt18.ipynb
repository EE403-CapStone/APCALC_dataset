    "Two particles move along the x-axis. For 0< t <80 , the position of particle P at time t is given by xp(t)=ln(t^2-2*t+10) , while the velocity of particle Q at time t is given by vq(t)=t^2-8*t+15. Particle Q is at position x = 5 at time t = 0.\n",

    "(b) For 0< t< 8, find all times t during which the two particles travel in the same direction.\n",
