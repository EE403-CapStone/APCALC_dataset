    "At time t = 0, a boiled potato is taken from a pot on a stove and left to cool in a kitchen. The internal temperature of the potato is 91 degrees Celsius (°C) at time t = 0, and the internal temperature of the potato is greater than 27 C° for all times t > 0. The internal temperature of the potato at time t minutes can be modeled by the function H that satisfies the differential equation dH/dt = -1/4*(H-27), where H(t) measured in degrees Celsius and H(0) = 91 .\n",

    "(c) For t < 10, an alternate model for the internal temperature of the potato at time t minutes is the function G that satisfies the differential equation dG/dt=-(G-27)^(2/3), where G(t) is measured in degrees Celsius and G(0) = 91. Find an expression for G(t). Based on this model, what is the internal temperature of the potato at time t = 3 ? \n"
