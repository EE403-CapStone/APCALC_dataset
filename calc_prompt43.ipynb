    "As a pot of tea cools, the temperature of the tea is modeled by a differentiable function H for 0<= t <= 10 where time t is measured in minutes and temperature H(t) is measured in degrees Celsius. Values of H(t) at selected values of time t are shown in the table above. \n",

    "(b) Using correct units, explain the meaning of 1/10*int(H(t), 0, 10, dt) in the context of this problem. Use a trapezoidal sum with the four subintervals indicated by the table to estimate 1/10*int(H(t), 0, 10, dt).\n",

    "(d) At time t = 0, biscuits with temperature 100 CÂ° were removed from an oven. The temperature of the biscuits at time t is modeled by a differentiable function B for which it is known that B'(t)=-13.84*e^(-.173*t). Using the given models, at time t = 10, how much cooler are the biscuits than the tea?\n"
