    "(c)\t The area, in square feet, of the horizontal cross section at height h feet is modeled by the function f given by f(h) = 50.3/(e^(.2*h)+h). Based on this model, find the volume of the tank. Indicate units of measure.\n",

    "(d) Water is pumped into the tank. When the height of the water is 5 feet, the height is increasing at the rate of 0.26 foot per minute. Using the model from part (c), find the rate at which the volume of water is changing with respect to time when the height of the water is 5 feet. Indicate units of measure. "
